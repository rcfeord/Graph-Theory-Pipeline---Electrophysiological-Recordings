# Graph-Theory-Pipeline---Electrophysiological-Recordings
A diagnostic tool for network activity patterns.

This repository contains the original version of the MEA Network Analysis Pipeline (MEA-NAP) found [here](https://github.com/SAND-Lab/MEA-NAP). Please use the MEA-NAP as the most up-to-date
version.


This pipeline is a diagnostic and analytic tool for cellular-scale network activity data obtained using microelectrode arrays. It provides a straight
forward way for new and experienced MATLAB users to quickly compare spike detection methods, neuronal activity (including firing rate and burst detection),
and functional connectivity (including network metrics from graph). The pipeline performs batch analysis of an experimental dataset (e.g., MEA recordings
from wild-type and knock-out cultures at multiple developmental time points). The pipeline produces summary plots and performs statistics on these features
and organises the output figures in a convenient file structure. The user can then identify network-level developmental or genotypic differences in their
MEA dataset.
